<h3>
    <p>Description</p>
</h3>

<p>
    As with all traditional foods, there are millions of variations and as usual there are multiple sources that insist that only their version is the 'real' one.
    In fact, there are some ingredients that go with every <strong>Bolognese</strong>. Others can be adapted, exchanged or even left out.
</p>

<p>
    I know Bolognese, for example, with different meats, sometimes with mixed minced meat, sometimes - as it is made a little further north - with very coarse minced pork, i.e. <em>ragu</em>
</p>

<h4>
<p>Ingredients for 8 people</p>
</h4>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 kg mixed minced meat
        <li> 1 large onion
        <li> 6 sticks of celery
        <li> 3 carrots
        <li> 200 ml of stock
        <li> 250 ml dry red wine
        <li> About 1.5 liters of Passata
        <li> Salt, fresh pepper
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>
    <p>Steps</p>
    </h4>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>First prepare all the ingredients. To do this, peel and chop the onion and peel and finely dice the carrots. 
                <p>Now remove the leaves from the celery, cut off the top and bottom and wash thoroughly. Now cut the celery</p>
                <p>into fine strips and put everything aside.</p>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large roasting pan or stockpot. Then brown the minced meat in it and then put it on a plate until you need it again. 
                <p>Now add another dash of oil to the pot and saut√© the vegetables and onion vigorously. Then pour the boiling</p>
                <p> water over it, season generously with salt, put the stove on a low heat and let the vegetables simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes.</p>
            <li>Remove the lid and turn the flame back up. Now add the minced meat to the vegetables, salt, bring to the boil and add the red wine. 
                <p>Now let everything boil vigorously for about 2 minutes, then add the passata and bay leaves. Finally, let everything</p>
                <p>cook uncovered over low to medium heat for 2 hours.</p>
        </ol>
